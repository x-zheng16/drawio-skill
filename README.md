# drawio-skill — From Text to Professional Diagrams

[中文文档](README_CN.md) | [Online Docs](https://agents365-ai.github.io/drawio-skill/)

## What it does

- Generates `.drawio` XML files from natural language descriptions
- Exports diagrams to PNG, SVG, PDF, or JPG using the native draw.io desktop CLI
- **6 diagram type presets**: ERD, UML Class, Sequence, Architecture, ML/Deep Learning, Flowchart — with preset shapes, styles, and layout conventions
- **Animated connectors** (`flowAnimation=1`) for data-flow and pipeline diagrams (visible in SVG and draw.io desktop)
- **ML model diagram support** with tensor shape annotations `(B, C, H, W)` — ideal for NeurIPS/ICML/ICLR papers
- **Grid-aligned layout** — all coordinates snap to 10px multiples for clean alignment
- **Browser fallback** — generates diagrams.net URLs when the desktop CLI is unavailable
- Iterative design: preview, get feedback, and refine diagrams until they look right
- **Auto-launch** draw.io desktop after export for manual fine-tuning
- Triggers automatically when diagrams would help explain complex systems
- **Style presets (v1.3 new)** — teach the skill your visual style from a `.drawio` file or image, save it by name, and apply it to future diagrams. See `## Style Presets` in SKILL.md.
- **Custom output directory (v1.4 new)** — ask for any output path (e.g. `./artifacts/`, `docs/images/`) and the skill will `mkdir -p` and export there; ideal for CI/CD artifact pipelines.

### Key advantages

1. **Self-check + iterative loop** — the only pure-SKILL.md solution that reads its own output and auto-fixes before showing the user, then supports multi-round refinement
2. **6 diagram type presets** — ERD, UML Class, Sequence, Architecture, ML/Deep Learning, Flowchart — each with preset shapes, styles, and layout conventions
3. **ML/DL model diagrams** — tensor shape annotations, layer-type color coding, encoder/decoder swimlanes — built for academic papers
4. **Multi-agent, zero-config** — works across 6 platforms with just the `skills/drawio-skill/` directory + draw.io desktop. No MCP server, no Python, no Node.js, no browser
5. **Production-grade layout** — grid-aligned coordinates, complexity-scaled spacing, routing corridors, hub-center strategy, animated connectors
6. **Browser fallback** — generates diagrams.net URLs when the desktop CLI is unavailable, plus auto-launch for desktop editing

## Supported diagram types

- **Architecture**: microservices, cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure), network topology, deployment — with tier-based swimlanes and hub-center strategy
- **ML / Deep Learning**: Transformer, CNN, LSTM, GRU architectures — with tensor shape annotations and layer-type color coding
- **Flowcharts**: business processes, workflows, decision trees, state machines — with semantic shape types (parallelogram I/O, diamond decisions)
- **UML**: class diagrams (inheritance/composition/aggregation arrows), sequence diagrams (lifelines, activation boxes)
- **Data**: ER diagrams (table containers, PK/FK notation), data flow diagrams (DFD)
- **Other**: org charts, mind maps, wireframes

## Prerequisites

The draw.io desktop app must be installed for diagram export:

### macOS

```bash
# Recommended — Homebrew
brew install --cask drawio

# Verify
drawio --version
```

### Windows

Download and install from: https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases

```powershell
# Verify
"C:\Program Files\draw.io\draw.io.exe" --version
```

### Linux

Download `.deb` or `.rpm` from: https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases

```bash
# Headless export (required on Linux servers without display)
sudo apt install xvfb  # Debian/Ubuntu
xvfb-run -a drawio --version
```

| Platform | Extra step |
|----------|------------|
| **macOS** | No extra steps after Homebrew install |
| **Windows** | Use full path if not in PATH |
| **Linux** | Wrap commands with `xvfb-run -a` for headless export |

## Installation

```bash
# Any agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, etc.)
npx skills add Agents365-ai/365-skills -g

# Claude Code only
> /plugin marketplace add Agents365-ai/365-skills
> /plugin install drawio
```

Manual install — clone into your agent's skills directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Agents365-ai/drawio-skill.git ~/.claude/skills/drawio-skill
```

Common paths: `~/.claude/skills/` (Claude Code), `~/.config/opencode/skills/` (Opencode), `~/.openclaw/skills/` (OpenClaw), `~/.agents/skills/` (Codex). Also indexed on [SkillsMP](https://skillsmp.com/skills/agents365-ai-drawio-skill-skill-md) and [ClawHub](https://clawhub.ai/agents365-ai/drawio-pro-skill).

## Updates

The skill auto-checks for updates once per 24 hours on first use in a conversation. When a new version is available, the agent prints a one-line notice in the reply. To apply:

```bash
cd <your-install-path>/drawio-skill && git pull
```

The check is read-only, self-throttled, and silent when up to date, offline, or not a git install — it won't block or slow the workflow.

Plugin-marketplace installs update automatically via the 365-skills umbrella. Package-manager installs handle updates themselves:

```bash
# Claude Code plugin
/plugin update drawio

# OpenClaw
clawhub update drawio-pro-skill

# SkillsMP
skills update drawio-skill
```

## Usage

Just describe what you want:

```
Create a microservices e-commerce architecture with API Gateway, auth/user/order/product/payment services,
Kafka message queue, notification service, and separate databases for each service
```

The agent will generate the `.drawio` XML file and export it to PNG automatically.

## Example

**Prompt:**
> Create a microservices e-commerce architecture with Mobile/Web/Admin clients, API Gateway,
> Auth/User/Order/Product/Payment services, Kafka message queue, Notification service,
> and User DB / Order DB / Product DB / Redis Cache / Stripe API

**Output:**

![Microservices Architecture](assets/microservices-example.png)

## Topology demos

The skill handles various diagram topologies with clean edge routing — no lines crossing through shapes.

### Star topology (7 nodes)

Central message broker with 6 microservices radiating outward. Edges enter Kafka from different sides, zero crossings.

![Star topology](assets/demo-star.png)

### Layered flow (10 nodes, 4 tiers)

E-commerce architecture with 2 cross-connections: Order→Product (same-tier horizontal) and Auth→Redis (diagonal via routing corridor). All edges route cleanly.

![Layered flow](assets/demo-layered.png)

### Ring / cycle (8 nodes)

CI/CD pipeline with a closed loop and 2 spur branches. Edges flow along the perimeter without crossing the interior.

## Files

- `skills/drawio-skill/SKILL.md` — **the only required file**. Loaded by all platforms as the skill instructions.
- `skills/drawio-skill/references/` — detail references (diagram types, style presets, extraction, troubleshooting)
- `skills/drawio-skill/scripts/` — bundled scripts (PNG repair, browser URL encoder)
- `skills/drawio-skill/styles/built-in/` — built-in style presets (`default.json`, `corporate.json`, `handdrawn.json`)
- `README.md` — this file (English, displayed on GitHub homepage)
- `README_CN.md` — Chinese documentation
- `assets/` — example diagrams and workflow images

> **Note:** Only `skills/drawio-skill/SKILL.md` and its `references/` + `scripts/` + `styles/` are needed for the skill to work. The `assets/` and README files are documentation only and can be safely deleted to save space.

> All example diagrams were generated by Claude Opus 4.6 with this skill.

## Style Presets

Style presets let you capture and reuse a visual style across diagrams. When a preset is active, it replaces the built-in color palette, shape vocabulary, fonts, and edge defaults.

### Built-in presets

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `default` | Clean blue/green/yellow palette matching the built-in conventions |
| `corporate` | Muted, professional palette suited for business presentations |
| `handdrawn` | Sketch-style strokes for informal or whiteboard-style diagrams |

### Apply a preset to a diagram

```
Draw a microservices architecture using my "corporate" style
```

Or set a default so all future diagrams use it automatically:

```
Make "corporate" my default style
```

### Learn your style from a file

Point the skill at any `.drawio` file or flat image:

```
Learn my style from ~/diagrams/brand.drawio as "mybrand"
Learn my style from ~/diagrams/screenshot.png as "mybrand"
```

The skill extracts colors, shapes, fonts, and edge style, renders a sample diagram for preview, and saves to `~/.drawio-skill/styles/mybrand.json` only after you approve.

### Manage presets

| What you say | What happens |
|---|---|
| "list my styles" | Shows all user and built-in presets in a table |
| "show my `<name>` style" | Pretty-prints the preset JSON |
| "make `<name>` the default" | Sets it as the active default for all diagrams |
| "remove default" | Clears the default (reverts to built-in conventions) |
| "delete `<name>`" | Deletes the user preset (prompts for confirmation) |
| "rename `<a>` to `<b>`" | Renames a user preset |

## Known Limitations

- **Command name varies by platform**: macOS Homebrew installs the command as `draw.io`; some Linux packages use `drawio`. The skill handles both, but verify which name works on your system with `draw.io --version` or `drawio --version`
- **Linux headless export**: Requires `xvfb` for display virtualization — without it, CLI export will fail on servers without a display
- **Browser fallback requires Python**: The `diagrams.net` URL generator uses `python3` for compression/encoding. If neither CLI nor Python is available, the skill generates `.drawio` XML only
- **Self-check requires vision**: The auto-fix step reads exported PNGs using the model's vision capability. Models without vision support skip this step
- **Cloud icons**: Currently supports basic AWS resource icons. GCP, Azure, and Kubernetes icon sets are not yet included
- **No source .drawio for microservices example**: The `microservices-example.png` in assets was generated in a session but the source `.drawio` was not preserved
